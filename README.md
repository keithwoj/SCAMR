Stout Computational Applied Mathematics Repository

Repository created by professors and students of the University of Wisconsin Stout (UW Stout). It is a warehouse of codes written in a variety of languages by to be used for numerical and scientific computation. Its purpose is for faculty and student researchers in the Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Sciences (AMCS) program to share their best ideas for scientific computing with one another. The code can be used for benchmarking novel algorithms, modeling and simulation, education, and experimentation.
